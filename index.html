            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>Please plan on being in Wausau, WI on 8/30. There is a local regional airport <a href="https://www.fly-cwa.org/" target="_blank">Central Wisconsin Airport (CWA)</a>. In order to fly into CWA you will most likely need to connect in; note there are fewer options as the flights in and out are limited.</p>
            
             <p>Our recommendation would be to fly into one of the bigger airports (possibly even coordinate with other people flying in that same day) and then drive the remainder in a rental car. This will give you more flexibility on flight times.

           <p>Suit rentals will be handled by <a href="https://www.generationtux.com/" target="_blank">Generation Tux</a> which is an online suit rental service. The site allows us to customize what's ordered to cut down on cost so we opted not to do the belt and shoes; please bring a black belt and laced black dress shoes. You should have received an email with instructions to register and send in your measurements. You will receive your suit in the mail two weeks before the wedding (enough time for any needed changes). Their staff is very responsive and available through the chat (button at the bottom right of their website) - any changes or assistnace you need can be coordinated through there, but they request you contact them within 48 hours of receiving the suit so they have ample time to send any new items. They will reimburse pressing and also tailoring (up to $20 per item).</p>

---Flight Tips---
There is a local regional airport Central Wisconsin Airport (CWA) however you will need to connect through a major airport. 

Madison, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis are all two hour drives by rental car; Chicago is about a 5 hour drive. There should be tons of direct options from Atlanta to these airports. 

I know Justin was looking to coordinate travel with folks from Atlanta so I'd highly encourage coordinating flights/hotel/rental cars. 

My recommendation to cut down on costs would be to coordinate flying in to the same airport (Minneapolis, Madison, or Milwaukee) and sharing a rental car and hotel room. 

---Hotel Block---

(Note: the Wedding is on Saturday 9/1 but we setup the block as early as Thursday 8/30 for those flying in early)
